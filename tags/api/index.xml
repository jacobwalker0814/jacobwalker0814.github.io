      <title>Geocommunicator API Client</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who travels around the country servicing natural gas pipelines.
As part of his duties he has to translate latitude / longitude coordinates into
state, township, range, and section information. He was doing this by hand
dozens of time per day. I found an API from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geocommunicator.gov/&#34;&gt;Department of the Interior&amp;rsquo;s
Bureau of Land Management&lt;/a&gt; which accepts coordinates and responds with the
exact information my friend needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jcbwlkr/livejournal-amnesia&#34;&gt;LiveJournal Amnesia&lt;/a&gt; is a quick script I wrote to automate the
process of hiding the 200-some LiveJournal blog posts I generated in my late
teens. It uses a public gem to talk to the LiveJournal API. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jcbwlkr/livejournal-amnesia&#34;&gt;the
README on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for more info then you, too, can pretend like
you never wrote that poem Junior year!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Ball Media Group&lt;/a&gt;. As a part of this team I worked on a web based
community platform for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/&#34;&gt;Adobe&lt;/a&gt;. The project utilized several different
APIs from Adobe and other vendors to create a white labeled site for connecting
and empowering creative youth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>At home my desktop PC acts as a UPNP media server and is the box I use to download torrents. This machine was inconveniently located in my basement. There were many times when I would want to start a download but the only device nearby is my phone. I found that finding and downloading a torrent file then getting it to my torrent machine was a cumbersome process. Furthermore, many sites that index torrent files contain advertising that ranges from annoying to inappropriate to explicit.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;InnoDB is a great storage engine for MySQL offering, among other things,
transaction support. One of its drawbacks is the difficulty that you can face
when corruption inevitably hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work we have dealt with corrupt InnoDB tables often enough to make the
procedure fairly routine. Last week I was faced with a situation that had me
pulling my hair out; in fact we almost threw in the towel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this particular instance I was connecting to the database with the standard
command line client &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt;. Every time I ran any query (against the corrupt
table or not) I was slapped in the face with the annoying &amp;ldquo;MySQL Server Has
Gone Away&amp;rdquo; message. Even queries like &lt;code&gt;SHOW PROCESSLIST;&lt;/code&gt; would trigger the
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right before we gave up I had an idea. When you start the client it gives you
the following message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-nohighlight&#34;&gt;Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that the client looks up meta information about the tables
and columns in your selected database so that when you hit &lt;kbd&gt;TAB&lt;/kbd&gt; it
will auto fill the table names like you would get on the command line. The list
of tables and columns is rebuilt any time you change databases or issue the
&lt;code&gt;REHASH;&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a hunch I tried starting the client with the &lt;code&gt;-A&lt;/code&gt; flag to prevent this table
scanning. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the technical reason within MySQL&amp;rsquo;s binaries but with
this option enabled my problem went away. I can only assume that when the
client scans the tables (including the corrupt table) something goes horribly
wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just file that away in your DBA utility belt :)&lt;/p&gt;

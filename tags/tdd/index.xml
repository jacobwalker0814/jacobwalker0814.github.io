      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://startupwichita.com&#34;&gt;Startup Wichita&lt;/a&gt; was a grass roots effort to connect entrepreneurs in
Wichita with local people and resources. In March 2014 &lt;a href=&#34;https://jacob-walker.com/portfolio/devict.html&#34;&gt;devICT&lt;/a&gt; held a
hackathon to kick-start development on the community site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From February 2015 to February 2016 I was a contracting engineer at &lt;a href=&#34;http://wreckingballmedia.com/&#34;&gt;Wrecking
Ball Media Group&lt;/a&gt;. As a part of this team I worked on a web based
community platform for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/&#34;&gt;Adobe&lt;/a&gt;. The project utilized several different
APIs from Adobe and other vendors to create a white labeled site for connecting
and empowering creative youth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>At home my desktop PC acts as a UPNP media server and is the box I use to download torrents. This machine was inconveniently located in my basement. There were many times when I would want to start a download but the only device nearby is my phone. I found that finding and downloading a torrent file then getting it to my torrent machine was a cumbersome process. Furthermore, many sites that index torrent files contain advertising that ranges from annoying to inappropriate to explicit.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BDD in Go is made easier using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/&#34;&gt;Ginkgo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://onsi.github.io/gomega/&#34;&gt;Gomega&lt;/a&gt;
packages. Gomega specifically provides a collection of matchers for asserting
that results match expectations. When using these tools to test an API I was
developing I noticed some common patterns appearing around the assertion of
HTTP status codes. I created the &lt;code&gt;github.com/jcbwlkr/httpmatchers&lt;/code&gt; package to
simplify some of those patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

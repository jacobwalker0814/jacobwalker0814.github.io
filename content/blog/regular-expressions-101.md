I recently joined a a great group of local developers called UpFront Wichita
(edit: now called [devICT](http://meetup.com/devict)). The organizers were so
gracious as to let me present last night on one of my favorite topics: Regular
Expressions.

We recorded the presentation using Google Hangouts on Air. The video is
available on [YouTube](http://youtu.be/4nyHF8dnIk "Regular Expressions 101 on
YouTube"). The slides, source code, and text files used for examples are
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/upfrontwichita/Regex101 "Regular
Expressions 101 on GitHub").

The video was our first attempt at recording one of these presentations. At our
next meetup we will do things a little differently to produce a better video
and to provide better support for remote participants that want to participate
in the hangout.

The presentation covers the most commonly used features of regex and some of
the nicer advanced features like backreferences and assertions. Most of the
research for the presentation comes from
[regular-expressions.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info/). Interested
readers should check out that site's references on some of the crazier things
you can do.

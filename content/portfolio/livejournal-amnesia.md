[LiveJournal Amnesia][site-source] is a quick script I wrote to automate the
process of hiding the 200-some LiveJournal blog posts I generated in my late
teens. It uses a public gem to talk to the LiveJournal API. Check out [the
README on GitHub][site-source] for more info then you, too, can pretend like
you never wrote that poem Junior year!

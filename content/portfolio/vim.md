When I started using Vim as my primary editor I found my second love. Its pure
efficiency combined with its extendability have yet to leave me seriously
wanting for any features. I have made some contributions back to the vim
ecosystem.

I previously maintained a fork of the popular [spf13-vim][spf13] distribution.
I have since abandoned that fork and created my own `.vimrc` which is hosted
with [my dotfiles][dotfiles].

I have also ported the default [Powerline][powerline] theme to the
`powerlineish` theme in the [vim-airline][airline] project. It's pretty neat to
look at someone else's `.vimrc` and see they're using the theme I ported :)

In March of 2015 I collaborated with my friend [Matthew M. Keeler][matthew] on
a pair of talks about our favorite editors. I covered the things that I love
about Vim and how I use it daily. The video is available on YouTube and has
over 8k views as of September 2016.

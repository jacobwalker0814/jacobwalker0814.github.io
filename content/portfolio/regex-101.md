In March 2013 I gave a presentation to my local development group
[devICT][devict] over the different forms and uses of Regular Expressions. The
talk was just under two hours long and was well received by the audience
(approximately 25 developers). The presentation was broadcast through Google
Hangouts On Air and the video is available on [YouTube][video].

The presentation covers the most commonly used features of regex and some of
the nicer advanced features like backreferences and assertions. Most of the
research for the presentation comes from
[regular-expressions.info][regex-site]. Interested readers should check out
that site's references on some of the crazier things you can do.

[Norris Training Systems][norris] provides pre-licensing and continuing
education training to insurance agents. My consulting company [Tortugas
Consulting, LLC][tortugas] developed their e-commerce website which allows
agents to purchase and schedule classes. Additionally agents can download
documents associated with their course and take related quizzes to prepare for
their state license exam.

The site was built on the [Symfony 2][sf2] framework. Another agency was
contracted to mock up the design which we implemented.

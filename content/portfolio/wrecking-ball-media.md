From February 2015 to February 2016 I was a contracting engineer at [Wrecking
Ball Media Group][wbm]. As a part of this team I worked on a web based
community platform for [Adobe][adobe]. The project utilized several different
APIs from Adobe and other vendors to create a white labeled site for connecting
and empowering creative youth.

For this project I primarily worked in Go. I developed the server application
composing middleware, Go templating, a REST API, request contexts, a service
layer, logger, internationalization, and both unit and integration tests.

Additionally I constructed the team's Continuous Integration and Continuous
Deployment pipelines using Ansible, Docker, Jenkins, Hipchat, and AWS.

Multiple deployments of the platform were completed during my time including
the [#WithMalala][malala] project and the [2015 Sundance Ignite
Challenge][sundance].

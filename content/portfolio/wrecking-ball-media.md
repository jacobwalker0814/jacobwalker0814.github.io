From February 2015 to February 2016 I was a contracting engineer at [Wrecking
Ball Media Group][wbm]. As a part of this team I worked on a web based
platform for [Adobe][adobe]. The project utilized several different APIs from
Adobe and other vendors.

For this project I primarily worked in Go. I developed the server application
composing middleware, Go templating, a REST API, request contexts, a service
layer, logger, internationalization, and both unit and integration tests.

Additionally I constructed the team's Continuous Integration and Continuous
Deployment pipelines using Ansible, Docker, Jenkins, Hipchat, and AWS.

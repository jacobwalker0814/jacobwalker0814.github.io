[Young Life Wichita][ylw] (YLW) is a local chapter of the larger Young Life
organization. YLW supports local families through various charitable events and
activities. My consulting company was hired to develop an online application
where people could RSVP for different activities.

The website was built on Rails 4 with Twitter Bootstrap. Another local agency
Barrett Morgan LLC developed the look which we implemented.

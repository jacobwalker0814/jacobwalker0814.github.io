devICT is the primary development community in Wichita, KS boasting over 150
members. The group covers all aspects of software development. Our mission is:

> To educate, empower, and connect software developers in the Wichita area.

I first joined the group in December of 2012 and have since become one of the
organizers. I help to organize and promote events, welcome new members, mediate
conflicts, and give presentations.

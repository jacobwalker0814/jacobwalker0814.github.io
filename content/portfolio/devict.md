devICT is the largest software development community in Wichita boasting over
500 registered members. Since joining in 2012 I have taken on the
responsibility of being the director. The group covers all aspects of software
development. Our mission is:

> To educate, empower, and connect software developers in the Wichita area.

I first joined the group in December of 2012 and took an active role from the
beginning. I help to organize and promote events, welcome new members, mediate
conflicts, and give presentations. In July of 2016 the group's founder [Seth
Etter][seth] switched his focus to running the civic tech group [Open
Wichita][ow]. I agreed to carry the torch.

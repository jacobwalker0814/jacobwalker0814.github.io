{"result": {"description": "<p>I have a friend who travels around the mid-west servicing natural gas\npipelines. As part of his duties he has to translate latitude / longitude\ncoordinates into state, township, range, and section information. He was doing\nthis by hand dozens of time per day. I found an API from the <a href=\"http://www.geocommunicator.gov/\">Departartment of\nthe Interior's Bureau of Land Management</a> which accepts coordinates and\nresponds with the exact information my friend needed. I created a client class\nthat can consume the API and another class that uses <a href=\"http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/\">PHPExcel</a> to\nparse an XLS spreadsheet with coordinates and populate it with the additional\ninformation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jacobwalker0814/geocommunicator-client\">Source</a></p>", "_id": "geocommunicator", "name": "Geocommunicator API Client"}}

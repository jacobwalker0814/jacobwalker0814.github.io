I found an API from the <a href=\"http://www.geocommunicator.gov/\">Department of the Interior's\nBureau of Land Management</a> which accepts coordinates and responds with the\nexact information my friend needed. I created a client class that can consume\nthe API and another class that uses <a href=\"http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/\">PHPExcel</a> to parse an XLS\nspreadsheet with coordinates and populate it with the additional information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jacobwalker0814/geocommunicator-client\">Source</a></li>\n</ul>"}}

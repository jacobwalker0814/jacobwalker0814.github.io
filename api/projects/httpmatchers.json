Gomega specifically provides a collection of matchers for asserting\nthat results match expectations. When using these tools to test an API I was\ndeveloping I noticed some common patterns appearing around the assertion of\nHTTP status codes. I created the <code>github.com/jcbwlkr/httpmatchers</code> package to\nsimplify some of those patterns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jcbwlkr/httpmatchers\">Source</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://godoc.org/github.com/jcbwlkr/httpmatchers\">Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>"}}

Since February 2013 I have been\nrunning a quasi-monthly game in the Red Hand of Doom campaign. As a personal\nproject I decided to build a campaign journal site. The site is intended to\nchronicle the adventures of the players and provide a convenient place to\ndistribute information.</p>\n<p>It currently uses <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> and is hosted on GitHub Pages. I intend to\nrewrite it as an <a href=\"https://angularjs.org\">Angular</a> application consuming an API generated by\nmy project <a href=\"/portfolio/pysag.html\">pysag</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jacob-walker.com/campaign-journal\">Site</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jacobwalker0814/campaign-journal\">Source</a></p>"}}

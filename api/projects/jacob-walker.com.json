It is styled with\nTwitter Bootstrap and HTML5 Boilerplate. It is hosted on GitHub Pages using my\ncustom domain name.</p>\n<p>The resume portion of this site is an interesting piece of work. My resume is\nstored as a markdown file for ease of updating and versioning. I developed a\nnode.js script that uses a third party node module to convert the markdown file\nto HTML and then PDF. My code further acts on the generated HTML to make the\nweb view of the resume. The PDF is formatted through CSS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jcbwlkr/jcbwlkr.github.io\">Site Source</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jcbwlkr/resume\">Resume Source</a></li>\n</ul>"}}

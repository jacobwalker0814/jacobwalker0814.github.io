{"result": {"description": "<p><a href=\"http://startupwichita.com\">Startup Wichita</a> is a grass roots effort to connect entrepreneurs in\nWichita with local people and resources. In March 2014 <a href=\"/portfolio/devict.html\">devICT</a> held a\nhackathon to kick-start development on a community site. We decided to build\nthe site on the <a href=\"mean\">MEAN stack</a> (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node). We\nprovisioned a development environment with <a href=\"http://puppetlabs.com\">Puppet</a> and\n<a href=\"http://vagrantup.com\">Vagrant</a>. We split into teams for content, design, front end\ndevelopment and back end development. I managed the various teams, helped\ndevelopers set up their environments, and merged pull requests.</p>\n<p>The hackathon laid the ground work for the application but at the end of the\nday there was still a lot of work to be done. Over the next several months\ndevICT members met periodically to push the site forward. Progress was slow as\neach developer was only working in their spare time.</p>\n<p>In September (6 months since the hackathon) the Entrepreneurship Task Force of\nthe Wichita Metro Chamber of Commerce hired my company <a href=\"http://tortugas-llc.com\">Tortugas Consulting,\nLLC</a> to dedicate development resources towards the completion of the\nsite. The first phase milestone was reached on October 21st 2014 with two\nadditional milestones planned over the next few months.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://startupwichita.com\">Startup Wichita site</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jacobwalker0814/regex-101\">Startup Wichita on GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>", "subtitle": "startupwichita.com", "name": "Startup Wichita", "tags": ["node", "mongo", "express", "angular", "bootstrap", "community", "tdd"], "_id": "startup-wichita", "order": 8, "summary": "A community resource website for entrepreneurs written on the MEAN.io stack."}}

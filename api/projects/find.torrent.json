{"result": {"description": "<p>At home my desktop PC acts as a UPNP media server and is the box I use to\ndownload torrents. This machine is inconveniently located in my basement. There\nwere many times when I would want to start a download but the only device\nnearby is my phone. I found that finding and downloading a torrent file then\ngetting it to my torrent machine was a cumbersome process. Furthermore, many\nsites that index torrent files contain advertising that ranges from annoying to\ninappropriate to explicit. I decided to create a service that facilitates the\nprocess of finding the .torrent files and triggering their download. The\nservice does not download the torrent itself; just the torrent file.</p>\n<p>When I started this project I knew that I wanted to build the service as a REST\nAPI that I could then consume through various clients. I intend to develop web,\ncommand line, android, and iPhone applications. The service is written in\n<a href=\"http://bulletphp.com/\">Bullet PHP</a> and serves the API with the <a href=\"http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html\">HAL Hypermedia Type</a>.\nThe service was written using a combination of TDD and BDD practices with tests\nin PHPUnit and Frisby.js.</p>\n<p>This is a collaborative work with my co-worker and business partner <a href=\"http://matthewmkeeler.com\">Matthew M.\nKeeler</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Tortugas-Consulting-LLC/find.torrent\">Source</a></p>", "_id": "find.torrent", "order": 4, "name": "find.torrent"}}

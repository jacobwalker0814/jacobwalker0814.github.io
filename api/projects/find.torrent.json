This machine was inconveniently located in my basement. There\nwere many times when I would want to start a download but the only device\nnearby is my phone. I found that finding and downloading a torrent file then\ngetting it to my torrent machine was a cumbersome process. Furthermore, many\nsites that index torrent files contain advertising that ranges from annoying to\ninappropriate to explicit. I decided to create a service that facilitates the\nprocess of finding the <code>.torrent</code> files and triggering their download. The\nservice does not download the torrent itself; just the torrent file.</p>\n<p>When I started this project I knew that I wanted to build the service as a REST\nAPI that I could then consume through various clients. I intend to develop web,\ncommand line, Android, and iOS applications. The service was written in <a href=\"http://bulletphp.com/\">Bullet\nPHP</a> and serves the API with the <a href=\"http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html\">HAL Hypermedia Type</a>. The\nservice was developed using a combination of TDD and BDD practices with tests in\nPHPUnit and Frisby.js.</p>\n<p>This is a collaborative work with my co-worker and business partner <a href=\"http://matthewmkeeler.com\">Matthew M.\nKeeler</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Tortugas-Consulting-LLC/find.torrent\">Source</a></p>"}}

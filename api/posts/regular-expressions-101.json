{"result": {"body": "<p>I recently joined a a great group of local developers called UpFront Wichita\n(edit: now called <a href=\"http://meetup.com/devict\">devICT</a>. The organizers were so\ngracious as to let me present last night on one of my favorite topics: Regular\nExpressions.</p>\n<p>We recorded the presentation using Google Hangouts on Air. The video is\navailable on <a href=\"http://youtu.be/4nyHF8dnIk\" title=\"Regular Expressions 101 on\nYouTube\">YouTube</a>. The slides, source code, and text files used for examples are\navailable on <a href=\"https://github.com/upfrontwichita/Regex101\" title=\"Regular\nExpressions 101 on GitHub\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>The video was our first attempt at recording one of these presentations. At our\nnext meetup we will do things a little differently to produce a better video\nand to provide better support for remote participants that want to participate\nin the hangout.</p>\n<p>The presentation covers the most commonly used features of regex and some of\nthe nicer advanced features like backreferences and assertions. Most of the\nresearch for the presentation comes from\n<a href=\"http://www.regular-expressions.info/\">regular-expressions.info</a>. Interested\nreaders should check out that site's references on some of the crazier things\nyou can do.</p>", "title": "Regular Expressions 101", "tags": ["regex", "community", "presentation"], "summary": "I have an unreasonable love of regex.

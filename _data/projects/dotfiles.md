It seems like every \*nix developer hosts at least their bashrc file on GitHub
and I am no exception. My repo uses the Ruby gem [homesick][homesick] to easily
keep my config files in sync. To further ease the process I can install or
update my config by running

```
bash <( curl -L http://bit.ly/jacobwalker )
```

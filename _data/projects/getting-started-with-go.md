This is a talk I presented at the first [Kansas Linux Fest][klf] in March 2015.
I gave it again that month at my company's internal roundtable and will present
it again for [devICT][devict] on July 23rd.

The talk introduces [the Go programming language][go] by highlighting some
important features and provides advice on how to be successful in adopting the
language.

Video to come soon.

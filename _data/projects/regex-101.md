In March 2013 I gave a presentation to my local web development group
[devICT][devict] over the different forms and uses of Regular Expressions. The
talk was just under two hours long and was well received by the audience
(approximately 25 developers). The presentation was broadcast through Google
Hangouts On Air and the video is available on [YouTube][video].

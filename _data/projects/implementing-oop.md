Back in June 2014 I gave a presentation to [devICT][devict] about how to use
Object Oriented Programming in PHP and Ruby. I chose this topic when I was
explaining inheritance to a friend and realized others would be interested. I
chose PHP and Ruby for examples because I was already familiar with OOP in PHP
and I wanted to learn more about Ruby's object model.

The talk is an hour and a half long. It covers the basic ideas and syntax of
OOP such as:

* Class vs Object
* Properties and Methods
* Access modifiers (public, private, protected)
* Inheritance
* Static or Class methods and properties
* Method overriding
* Abstract classes
* Interfaces

devICT is a local development community that covers all aspects of development.
I first joined the group in December of 2012 and have made it a priority to be
actively involved. I help to organize events, find and engage new members, and
give presentations.

The group's home on the web is [devict.org][devict] The site was previously
hosted on Heroku but has since been moved to a VPS. The application runs on
Rails. I have made several contributions to the site such as setting up
infrastructure, the user management system, and the IRC users integration.

[Startup Wichita][site] is a grass roots effort to connect entrepreneurs in
Wichita with local people and resources. In March 2014 [devICT][devict] held a
hackathon to kick-start development on a community site. We decided to build
the site on the [MEAN stack](mean) (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node). We
provisioned a development environment with [Puppet][puppet] and
[Vagrant][vagrant]. We split into teams for content, design, front end
development and back end development. I managed the various teams, helped
developers set up their environments, and merged pull requests.

The hackathon laid the ground work for the application but at the end of the
day there was still a lot of work to be done. Over the next several months
devICT members met periodically to push the site forward. Progress was slow as
each developer was only working in their spare time.

In September (6 months since the hackathon) the Entrepreneurship Task Force of
the Wichita Metro Chamber of Commerce hired my company [Tortugas Consulting,
LLC][tortugas] to dedicate development resources towards the completion of the
site. The first phase milestone was reached on October 21st 2014 with two
additional milestones planned over the next few months.

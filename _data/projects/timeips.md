From October 2010 to February 2015 the majority of my development focus has
been with my employer TimeIPS. We made a time and attendance system which is
used by thousands of companies around the world.

TimeIPS is used to

* Track employee hours worked from a variety of hardware and software interfaces
* Record benefit usages and accruals
* Monitor employee adherence to schedules
* Ensure employee coverage for particular tasks or locations
* Calculate FLSA overtime
* Record piecework pay such as tips and bonuses
* Serve company documents to employees and managers
* Calculate automatic holiday rules
* And many other things

At TimeIPS I lead a team of 4 in the development of our products. Some of my
major accomplishments in this role include:

* Introducing Test Driven Development with [PHPUnit][phpunit]
* Implementing Continuous Integration with [Jenkins-CI][jenkins]
* Starting code reviews via [Phabricator][phabricator]
* Leading the development of a REST API
* Working to update legacy code to use the [Doctrine 2][doctrine] ORM
* Implementing a Zero Defect policy
* Developing a system for managing our farm of QEMU virtual machines
* Revamped our build process making heavy use of [Composer][composer],
  [Gulp][gulp], and [Bower][bower]

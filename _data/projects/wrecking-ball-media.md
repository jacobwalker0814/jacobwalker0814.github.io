Since February 2015 I have been a contracting engineer at [Wrecking Ball Media
Group][wbm]. As a part of this team I am working on a web based platform for
[Adobe][adobe]. The project utilizes several different APIs from Adobe and
other vendors. More project details to come after the project launches.

For this project I primarily am working in Go. I have developed the server
application composing middleware, Go templating, a REST API, request contexts,
a service layer, logger, internationalization, and unit and integration tests.

Additionally I have constructed the team's Continuous Integration and
Continuous Deployment pipelines using Ansible, Docker, Jenkins, Hipchat, and
AWS.

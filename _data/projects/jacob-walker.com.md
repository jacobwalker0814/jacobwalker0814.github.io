My portfolio is part of my portfolio... how meta!

The site is generated using my site generator [pysag][pysag]. It is styled with
Twitter Bootstrap and HTML5 Boilerplate. It is hosted on GitHub Pages using my
custom domain name.

The resume portion of this site is an interesting piece of work. My resume is
stored as a markdown file for ease of updating and versioning. I developed a
node.js script that uses a third party node module to convert the markdown file
to HTML and then PDF. My code further acts on the generated HTML to make the
web view of the resume. The PDF is formatted through CSS.

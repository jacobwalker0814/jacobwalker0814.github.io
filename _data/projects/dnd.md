Since my early teens I have been passionate about Role Playing Games with a
special emphasis on Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Since February 2013 I have been
running a quasi-monthly game in the Red Hand of Doom campaign. As a personal
project I decided to build a campaign journal site. The site is intended to
chronicle the adventures of the players and provide a convenient place to
distribute information.

It currently uses [Jekyll][jekyll] and is hosted on GitHub Pages. I intend to
rewrite it as an [Angular][angular] application consuming an API generated by
my project [pysag][pysag].

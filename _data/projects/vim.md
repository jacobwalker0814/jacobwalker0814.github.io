When I started using Vim as my primary editor I found my second love. Its pure
efficiency combined with its extendability have yet to leave me seriously
wanting for any features. I maintain a fork of the popular [spf13-vim][spf13]
distribution. I have also contributed a new theme to the [vim-airline][airline]
project.

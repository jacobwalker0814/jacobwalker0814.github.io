When I started using Vim as my primary editor I found my second love. Its pure
efficiency combined with its extendability have yet to leave me seriously
wanting for any features. I previously maintained a fork of the popular [spf13-vim][spf13] distribution. I have since abandoned that fork and created my own `.vimrc` which is hosted with [my dotfiles][dotfiles].

I have also ported the default [Powerline][powerline] theme to the
`powerlineish` theme in the [vim-airline][airline] project.

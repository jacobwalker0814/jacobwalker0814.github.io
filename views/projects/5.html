<h1>UpFront Wichita</h1>
<p>
    UpFront is a local development community that covers all aspects of web development. I first joined the group in December of 2012 and have made it a priority to be actively involved. I help to organize events, find and engage new members, and give presentations.
</p>
<p>
    The group's home on the web is <a href="http://upfrontwichita.com">upfrontwichita.com <i class="icon-external-link"></i></a>. The site was previously hosted on Heroku but has since been moved to a VPS. The application runs on Rails. I have made several contributions to the site such as setting up infrastructure, the user management system, and the IRC users integration.

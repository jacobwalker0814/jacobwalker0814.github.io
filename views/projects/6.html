<h1>D&D Campaign Journal</h1>
<p>
    Since my early teens I have been passionate about Role Playing Games with a special emphasis on Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Since February 2013 I have been running a quasi-monthly game in the Red Hand of Doom campaign. As a personal project I decided to build a campaign journal site. The site is intended to chronicle the adventures of the players and provide a convenient place to distribute information. It uses <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll <i class="icon-external-link"></i></a> and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
